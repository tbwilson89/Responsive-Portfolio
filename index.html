          <h3>! PAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION !</h3>
          <p>Solutions-driven Full Stack Web Developer with a focus on back end development, dedicated to building dynamic, efficient and functional applications. Acquired a certification through the SMU full stack web development certificate program, where my projects were consistently recognized for their quality and ingenuity.</p>
          <p>Through self teaching and the SMU bootcamp I have acquired a solid understanding of the web development technologies of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and both SQL and MongoDB as well as the React framework and general understandings of various other languages from C# to Python. Having a collective nine years in the technology field, which mostly consisted of support for school districts, I’ve obtained the skills to properly troubleshoot issues efficiently and with the customer / client in mind. I’m constantly trying to find the best way to solve a problem and will consistently be researching different ways to solve similar problems for the best possible solution.</p>
          <p>Programming has become an enjoyable part of my life, almost like solving puzzles as a career. My passion for strategically solving problems combined with my extensive experience troubleshooting and working in tech, equip me for a future as a Back End Web Developer.</p>
