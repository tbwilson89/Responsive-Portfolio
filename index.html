        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently working on this page so it will be evolving over time, so look forward to what I will bring in the future!</p>
        <p>In the past I've primarily worked in the IT field within school districts, with over nine years of total experience between the many jobs that I've had. I've also started my own business along side my normal full time job in the past, successfully running it for slightly over two years before deciding to sell it to give myself more time to focus on my job and pursuing other interests, like learning web development!</p>
        <p>Currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp through SMU and hoping to move myself into a different career once completed.</p>
